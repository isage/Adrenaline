| ePSX        | PS Vita's stock pspemu in PS1 mode. Uses a modified version of POPS running on the Vita's built-in PSP hardware, with sound emulation and screen upscaling handled by the native Vita hardware/software. It uses the same PSPemu as ePSP, with a flag that changes its behavior when playing PS1 games.|
| vPSP        | Adrenaline-patched pspemu with mixed PSP/PS1 mode. The Adrenaline patches make it behave more similarly to a real PSP, hence a true Virtual PSP.                                                                                                                                                       |

| VitaPOPS    | A modified version of POPS for the PS Vita. It is largely based on 6.60 with several changes, mainly related to sound emulation, now handled by the Vita itself since ePSP lacks the Media Engine coprocessor used by POPS on PSP to emulate sound.                                                    |
